 It's my first Node.js project, I developed a comprehensive shop application using HTML, CSS, and Express middleware.
 The project includes various functionalities such as an admin section with the ability to add products (admin.js),
 a user-friendly shopping experience (shop.js), and a contact form for user inquiries (contactus.js).
 I structured the project with multiple files and folders, including a 'routes' directory for clear separation of concerns and a 'views' folder housing HTML files for different pages.
 The consistent header bar across all pages enhances the user interface. Notably, the project features a 404 error page and a success page for a polished user experience. 
 Through this project, I gained practical experience in managing routes, handling form submissions, and maintaining a clean codebase. The implementation of various pages, 
 including the main landing page and specialized pages, reflects my commitment to delivering a functional and user-friendly web application. 
 This project represents my foundational skills in Node.js and showcases my ability to organize code effectively for scalable web development projects.
